problems:
1. user ids are posted on the server level, not user level
  possible fix: put the println on the spawn level. may not even have to
    make list_of_users arc mutex
2. when a user posts a message, it should show their user_id + their message.
  example: 
    user1000: user's message goes here
  potential fix: in the second arm of tokio::select, perhaps remove
    the addr != other_addr condition 


changes/possible future updates:
1. on the server level, it should say `user_id connected`
2. once the server thing gets going, post pics of the chat server to github


notes:
1. idk if i can fix this, but windows powershell 7 (and maybe
  other terminals too) has a weird quirk with typing where you can't erase
  characters. instead, backspace goes back and you can only replace characters.
  tbqh, this might not even be an issue
